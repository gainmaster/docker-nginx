# cores if changing this parameter.

    ### DEFAULTS

    # Hide nginx version information.
    server_tokens off;

    # Define the MIME types for files.
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    # Format to use in log files
    log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                      '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                      '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    # Default log file
    # (this is only used when you don't override access_log on a server{} level) 
    
    access_log /dev/stdout;
    error_log /dev/stdout;
    
    # How long to allow each connection to stay idle; longer values are better
    # for each individual client, particularly for SSL, but means that worker
    # connections are tied up longer. (Default: 65)
    keepalive_timeout 20;
    
    # Speed up file transfers by using sendfile() to copy directly
    # between descriptors rather than using read()/write().
    sendfile        on;
    
    # Tell Nginx not to send out partial frames; this increases throughput
    # since TCP frames are filled up before being sent out. (adds TCP_CORK)
    tcp_nopush      on;

    ### COMPRESSION    

    # Enable Gzip compressed.
    gzip on;
    # Compression level (1-9).
    # 5 is a perfect compromise between size and cpu usage, offering about
    # 75% reduction for most ascii files (almost identical to level 9).
    gzip_comp_level    5;

    # Don't compress anything that's already small and unlikely to shrink much
    # if at all (the default is 20 bytes, which is bad as that usually leads to
    # larger files after gzipping).
    gzip_min_length    256;

    # Compress data even for clients that are connecting to us via proxies,
    # identified by the "Via" header (required for CloudFront).
    gzip_proxied       any;

    # Tell proxies to cache both the gzipped and regular version of a resource
    # whenever the client's Accept-Encoding capabilities header varies;
    # Avoids the issue where a non-gzip capable client (which is extremely rare
    # today) would display gibberish if their proxy gave them the gzipped version.
    gzip_vary          on;

    # Compress all output labeled with one of the following MIME-types.
    gzip_types
    application/atom+xml
    application/javascript
    application/json
    application/rss+xml

    image/svg+xml
    image/x-icon
    text/css
    text/plain
    text/x-component;
    # text/html is always compressed by HttpGzipModule


    # This should be turned on if you are going to have pre-compressed copies (.gz) of
    # static files available. If not it should be left off as it will cause extra I/O
    # for the check. It is best if you enable this in a location{} block for
    # a specific directory, or on an individual server{} level.
    # gzip_static on;
